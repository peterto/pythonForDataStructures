What is recursion:
---
- technique where a function calls itself one or more times (most often case)
- DS uses smaller instances of the same DS to represent itself

Why use recursion:
---
- Powerful alt for performing repetitive tasks
- most prog languages support recursion
- recursion is a great tool for building out certain DS

Examples
---
- factorial, n! = n * (n - 1) * (n - 2)...
- if n = 0, then n! = 1
- 4! = 4 * (3 * 2 * 1) = 4 * 3! = 4 * 3 * 2! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1! = 24
- n! = n * (n - 1)!
  - base case is n = 0 
- recursion + base case
- base case is the end of the recursion function
